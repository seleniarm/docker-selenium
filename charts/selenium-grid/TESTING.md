## Test Chart Template
- By using `helm template` command, the chart template is tested without installing it to Kubernetes cluster.
- Templates are rendered and the output as a YAML manifest file. The manifest file is then asserted with [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation).
- Set of values are used to render the templates located in [tests/charts/templates/render](../../tests/charts/templates/render).

```bash
# Back to root directory
cd ../..

# Build chart dependencies and lint
make chart_build

# Test chart template
make chart_test_template
```
- Build chart dependencies and lint requires [Chart Testing `ct`](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing). There is a config file [ct.yaml](../../tests/charts/config/ct.yaml) to configure the chart testing.

## Build & test Docker images with deploy to Kubernetes cluster
Noted: These `make` commands are composed and tested on Linux x86_64.
Run entire commands to build and test Docker images with Helm charts in local environment.

```bash
# Back to root directory
cd ../..

# Setup Kubernetes environment
make chart_setup_env

# Build Docker images
make build

# Build and lint charts
make chart_build

# Setup Kubernetes cluster
make chart_cluster_setup

# Test Selenium Grid on Kubernetes
make chart_test

# make chart_test_parallel_autoscaling

# Cleanup Kubernetes cluster
make chart_cluster_cleanup
```
- Setup Kubernetes environment requires [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) and [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
- Set of values are used to deploy the chart to Kubernetes cluster located in [tests/charts/ci](../../tests/charts/ci).
